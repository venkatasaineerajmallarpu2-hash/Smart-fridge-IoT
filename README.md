# Smart-fridge-IoT
(IOT based temperature and inventory monitoring system) :
   This project is an IOT-enabled Smart Fridge System that monitors real time temperature and tracks basic inventory to ensure safe food storage. The system alerts users when the temperature crosses safe limits. this system is built using sensors and a microcontroller like ESP32/Arduino.
   FEATUERES:
      1.Real time temperature monitoring 
      2.alerts when temperature is too high or low
      3.prevents food spoilage
      4.simple and cost effective system
  TECHNOLOGIES USED:
      1.ESP32/Arduino(Microcontroller)
      2.DHT11(Sensor)
      3.Breadboard, Jumper wires(tools)
  WORKING:
      1.Temperature sensor continuously monitors fridge temperature
      2.the microcontroller reads the sensor data
      3.if the temperature crossed safe limits, the system triggers(buzzer/notification)
  MY-CONTIBUTION:
      1.Intefrated temperature sensor with ESP32/Arduino
  CONCLUSION:
      The smart fridge project demonstrates how iot technology can make traditional appliances more efficient and reliable. By monitoring temperature in real time and providing alerts thsi system helps prevent food spoilage and promotes better energy
