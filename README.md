 Smart-Fridge-IoT

IoT-Based Temperature and Inventory Monitoring System

 Overview:
   This project is an IoT-enabled Smart Fridge System that monitors real-time temperature and tracks basic inventory to ensure safe food storage. The system alerts users when the temperature crosses safe limits. The project is built using sensors and a microcontroller such as ESP32/Arduino.

 Features:
     1.Real-time temperature monitoring

     2.Alerts when temperature is too high or low

     3.Prevents food spoilage

     4.Simple and cost-effective IoT solution

 Technologies Used :

     1.ESP32 / Arduino (Microcontroller)
     2.DHT11(Temperature Sensor)
     3.Jumper Wires
     4.Arduino IDE


Working:

     1. The temperature sensor continuously monitors the fridge temperature.


     2. The microcontroller reads the sensor data.


     3. If the temperature crosses safe limits, the system triggers an alert (buzzer / notification).


 My Contribution:

     1.Integrated the temperature sensor with ESP32/Arduino

     2.Designed and built the circuit

     3.Implemented sensor monitoring logic

 Conclusion:

       The Smart Fridge project demonstrates how IoT technology can make traditional appliances more efficient and reliable. By monitoring temperature in real time and providing alerts, this system helps prevent food spoilage and promotes better energy usage.
